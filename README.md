In this project you will solve model equations describing the time-evolution of healthy and
infected people in connected populations.
Different strategies for minimizing effects of a disease, such as vaccination, should be
studied.
Your job is:
1. choose your “favorite” disease and favorite cities
2. figure out, using “appropriate” sources, realistic parameters for that disease.
3. include realistic parameters for traveling dynamics between populations.
4. solve the appropriate rate equations numerically
5. investigate the effect of vaccination or quarantine on disease spreading patterns.
