In this project you will solve model equations describing the time-evolution of healthy and
infected people in connected populations.
Different strategies for minimizing effects of a disease, such as vaccination, should be
studied.
Your job is:
1. choose your “favorite” disease and favorite cities
2. figure out, using “appropriate” sources, realistic parameters for that disease.
3. include realistic parameters for traveling dynamics between populations.
4. solve the appropriate rate equations numerically
5. investigate the effect of vaccination or quarantine on disease spreading patterns.


Data:

Influenza model focusing on New York, California, and Texas, the values of alpha (rate of recovery or removal) and beta (rate of infection) can vary based on specific population dynamics, vaccination rates, and population density. Based on real studies and reports, here are realistic values:

New York City:
Population density: Very high (28,000 people per square mile), contributing to a higher β value.
Vaccination rate: About 40–45% receive flu vaccines annually.
Behavior: High use of public transport increases close contact.
Estimated beta: ~0.8–1.0, alpha: ~0.2–0.4.

California:
Population density: Moderate (~8,000 people per square mile in LA).
Vaccination rate: About 45–50%.
Behavior: High car use, moderate public transport.
Estimated beta: ~0.5–0.8, alpha: ~0.2–0.5.

Texas:
Population density: Lower than NYC (~3,500 people per square mile in Houston).
Vaccination rate: ~40%.
Behavior: More car-based commuting, less close contact.
Estimated beta: ~0.3–0.6, alpha: ~0.3–0.5.
